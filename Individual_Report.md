* What processing steps did you take?
  * I knew that I should standardize any numerical variables, as well as encode any categorical variables that I wanted to use. I utilized pipelines and randomized search cross validation steps to put my model together.
* How did you tune hyperparameters
  * I utilized random search cross validation to help tune my KNN hyperparameters as well as some of the other parameters like weight and imputer strategy.
* How did you select your final model and what was it?
  * I used multiple correlation heat maps to make initial judgments about which numeric variables to include in my final model. I used chi-squared tests to determine which categorical variables I should use in my final model.
* What is your out-of-sample mean absolute error?
* What features seem to be the most important in the prediction?
